# Quake II: Zelda Edition

Final Project - Quake II: Zelda Edition

This mod changes Quake II to make it play more like a game from Nintendo's iconic "The Legend of Zelda" series. Elements and mechanics from both the 2D games and 3D games have been implemented to add to the experience.

## Common Deliverables
* Desktop shortcut to launch mod
* Separate folder containing files needed for mod to work
* README file that explains mod in detail and shows how to test deliverables
* In-game help screen to explain mod changes
* UI updates reflecting project deliverables

## Project Deliverables

### Replace Quake II weapons with Zelda weapons
* The blaster has been replaced by the master sword. Each time you shoot the blaster, the bolt acts as a "sword beam". This is one of Link's recurring sword skills in the Zelda series. The bolt now disappears after travelling a set distance from the player, given that it does not hit any surface or entity. [WIP]

### Upgradable weapons

### 5 spells to cast
Players can choose from 5 different spells to activate during a playthrough, each with its own specified cost. Four of these spells have a set duration for 15 seconds. All spells include custom UI elements that are fully functional in-game. The spell system is derived from "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link". To see how this system works in more detail, open the console by pressing tilde (~) and type 'spell'. You should see the following:

The player starts off with 64 magic points, the default amount that Link has in the beginning of Zelda II. Each spell will be occupied with a description, followed by in-game screenshots to showcase their functionality.

The 'fire' spell allows the player to shoot fireballs out of the sword from a distance. In the context of Quake II, the particles shot from the BFG are used to portray Link's fireballs. <br />
